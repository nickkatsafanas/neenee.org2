"In this country, nobody really knows how to quantify Greeks, that's for sure. Most people think the Greeks are a group of people who died long ago, that the original Greeks are all dead. They died in the Golden Age and left behind a great ancient literature and so forth. They're not aware of Seferis, they're not aware of Yannis Ritsos, Yiorgos Seferis and C.P. Cavafy, they're not aware of Xenakis, they're not aware of any of these people. They think that it's a dead culture. This country, whereas it's more and more scrupulous, let's say, about recognizing other cultures, is very remiss in recognizing Middle Eastern cultures, which includes Greek cultures."<br>

"Not much better was the situation of Greece . . . it was still 'too Oriental' in many respects to govern itself."<br>

When we think of Greek history in America we often find ourselves lost in an ahistorical fiction—that a small group of unparalleled thinkers existed in Attica three to four hundred years prior to the birth of Christ and 'invented' the Western Civilization that would bloom in Western Europe some 1500 years after Christ's death. <br>
<br>
The question of how—or, more appropriately, IF—the entire world went into a prolonged intellectual dark age for almost two centuries between Ancient Athens and Renaissance Florence remains unposed. These Ancient Athenians must remain divorced from tangible concerns like geography and history, messy entanglements that would thrust Western Europe's highly advanced civilization into the Byzantine districts of the Balkans, Asia Minor, Anatolia, the Levant, and North Africa. They must remain abstract concepts and half-decayed busts—Socrates, Plato, Aristotle; The Father, The Son, The Holy Spirit. <br>
<br>
Modern Greeks, if we can even call them Greek, are hence a curious lot, with gibberish-adjacent last names, tendencies toward ethnic ambiguity, and cuisine that features items like grape leaves and lamb butt. We'd might call them Arabs but they never spoke Arabic; we'd probably even deem them Muslims but they practice an arcane form of Christianity, originating from a so-called 'Empire' no one remembers or cares about. In America most of them shamelessly alter their names, hoping to be mistaken for Argentinian whites or Southern Italians.<br>
<br>
But if we discard brilliant boy-lovers like Plato and Socrates for a moment, we can see the perspective of the historical Greeks is somewhat incisive. To be Greek, historically speaking, was to be forced to gaze East and West simultaneously, in perpetuity. To be shunned as exotic baboons by the Protestants and Catholics of both pre- and post-intellectual Europe and designated as infidels by the Caliphates of the Muslim world. It's maybe in this way more than any other that I identify with my Greek lineage. It's definitely only in this way that I prove myself to be a historical Greek.<br>
<br>
It could be interesting to speculate why it is—as Diamanda Galas observes above—that America remains remiss in recognizing Middle Eastern cultures, which include Greek cultures. At times it seems as though America can only operate with two disparate cultural poles, distinct and with nothing in between them—one so-called White, originally derived from Anglo-Saxon colonists, and the other so-called Black and originally derived from West African slaves. <br>
<br>
If this is the case, certain cultures remain foreign to America because America is incapable of looking two ways at once; it only stares at itself in perpetuity from each pole. Hence if a culture is unfit for absorption into one of said so-called racial poles its fate is sealed—it disappears from our cultural conversation and becomes gibberish.<br>
<br>
With this in mind I created <i>Paul Volcker's Dilemma</i> in the Rebetiko style of the old underground Greek hookah bars of the mid-20th Century. (I was particularly inspired by the body of work created by Markos Vamvakaris, who, to the best of my knowledge, has never been featured by an American music media outlet.) I consider this record an American iteration of a genre that was birthed by people who had no choice but to fix their gaze in two directions at once.<br>
