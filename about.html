"American Rebetiko: A Brief Note"<br>

"In this country, nobody really knows how to quantify Greeks, that's for sure. Most people think the Greeks are a group of people who died long ago, that the original Greeks are all dead. They died in the Golden Age and left behind a great ancient literature and so forth. They're not aware of Seferis, they're not aware of Yannis Ritsos, Yiorgos Seferis and C.P. Cavafy, they're not aware of a lot of the writers and musicians, they're not aware of Xenakis, they're not aware of any of these people. They think that it's a dead culture. This country, whereas it's more and more scrupulous, let's say, about recognizing other cultures, is very remiss in recognizing Middle Eastern cultures, which includes Greek cultures."<br>

"The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato."<br>

"Not much better was the situation of Greece . . . it was still 'too Oriental' in many respects to govern itself."<br>

The songs on <i>Paul Volcker's Dilemma</i> were inspired by the Rebetiko of Markos Vamvakaris, who to my surprise doesn't seem to have a single reference to his name in any English speaking music media outlet, despite being known by just Markos in Greeceâ€”and by <i>Secrets of the Temple</i> by William Greider, a great book that gave me the idea to use Paul Volcker as a protagonist for the record.<br>
<br>
But I'd like to take a minute to address the point made by Diamanda Galas above.<br> 
<br>
It's a curious thing. Because since the end of the Second World War America has been, to speak in euphemisms, "diplomatically active" in the Middle East. And for the past two decades we've been engaged in an unrelenting War Against Radical Islam. <br>
<br>
Yet you would be hard pressed to find a major American news outlet that devotes any time attempting to inform viewers on the difference between the Sunni and Shia interpretations of Islam, or the history of Wahhabism and its relation to the formation of the modern Saudi Arabian state. Or better yet: on the scholars who laid the philosophical foundation of the Ba'ath Party and pan-Arab socialism.<br>
<br>
A highly regarded philosopher like Alfred North Whitehead remarks that European philosophy is merely a "footnote" to a sole Athenian philosopher who lived more than 350 years before Christ's birth. Yet as recently as the decades following the conclusion of the Second World War the Greeks were considered a tad "too Oriental" to govern themselves without Western supervision.<br>
<br>
It almost makes too much sense why America would have no interest in the cultures that developed on the borders where Europe, Asia, and Africa intersect. The so-called "Christians of the Orient" along with Persians, Turks, and Arabs who, in between brutal wars, developed advanced cultures of literature, music, and philosophy side-by-side are inconvenient for a plethora of reasons.<br>
<br>
But Rebetiko is obviously just a small slice of these cultures. I discovered it through my research into the tradition of amanes in Greece and Turkey, which I found while looking into the Greek Liturgies I used to attend as a kid, that were the only aspect of Greek school that ever struck me as interesting, because they seemed so totally absurd in comparison to American music, which in many ways seems to have never left the Jim Crow era.<br>
