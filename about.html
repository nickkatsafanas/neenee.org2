"American Rebetiko: A Brief Note"<br>
<br>
"In this country, nobody really knows how to quantify Greeks, that's for sure . . . This country, whereas it's more and more scrupulous, let's say, about recognizing other cultures, is very remiss in recognizing Middle Eastern cultures, which includes Greek cultures."<br>
<br>
- Diamanda Galas<br>
<br>
The songs on <i>Paul Volcker's Dilemma</i> were inspired by the Rebetiko of Markos Vamvakaris and the book <i>Secrets of the Temple</i> by William Greider.<br>
<br>
Paul Volcker is one of the more interesting historical figures that no one outside of CNBC ever talks about. Like so many powerful institutions in our country, the Federal Reserve isn't poorly understood as much as it's ignored in favor of scrutinizing a tweet. But Volcker arguably had more to do with the economic direction of the United States since the end of the 1980s than Ronald Reagan. He definitely did more to break unions and ships jobs overseas than any political figure of the decadeâ€”even if it was under the (possibly necessary) guise of "breaking inflation".<br>
<br>
Markos I find interesting maybe because I find most American music today so boring. As Americans we spend a lot of time congratulating ourselves on being the most innovative country in the world, yet for the last 70 years no one has played much of anything besides an electric guitar and a laptop.<br>
