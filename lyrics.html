PAUL VOLCKER'S DILEMMA<br>
NICK KATSAFANAS<br>
LYRICS<br>
<br>
"21 Choices of Cereal for Paul Volcker"<br>
<br>
Paul Volcker sat smoking a cigar in front of 21 cereal boxes<br>
his neighbor Jill said keep the music down, he thought she was obnoxious<br>
he was trying to decide which bowl of cereal to pour himself for dinner <br>
in his cottage in Toulon France he winced acutely from a finger tip splinter <br>
<br>
Paul knew a lot about decisions from his days at the Federal Reserve <br>
even the tiniest ones rippled unimpeded without restraint thru the world <br>
our lives are drowned in the infinite reverberations of these decisions <br>
it's very mysterious, he thinks, how we remain so lucid while living <br>
<br>
<br>
"Decisions, Decisions"<br>
<br>
Paul Volcker says there's no reason to believe decimal points are anything more than periods<br>
he says Proper punctuation is important<br>
he thinks assassinations are mysterious<br>
he thinks modern bourgeois housewives are integral components of our consumer society<br>
he enjoys well placed rugs and exquisitely constructed kitchen islandery<br>
<br>
Paul takes a deep breath perusing these cereal boxes<br>
decisions, decisions - the fulcrum's composed of flotsam<br>
he sat alone when a Portugese prostitute told him was ruining himself drinking<br>
he said Funny that you mention it, because that's what I've been thinking<br>
<br>
<br>
"Games of Inches"<br>
<br>
Lucky Charms, Count Chocula, Coco Krispies, Raisin Bran<br>
Paul just hated inflation, decimating labor was never his plan<br>
He thinks How can we blame banks for dock workers jumping off bridges<br>
He thinks The bond market is made of pig skin, a game of inches<br>
<br>
Paul Volcker smokes a cigar and considers the uptick in suicides<br>
Young men crushed by debt with no job prospects kissing chrome goodbye<br>
He loves Lucky Charms but it's a little sweet for this time of night<br>
He looks at his watch, scratches his hand,<br>
ambivalently mutters You can't protest what you can't understand<br>
<br>
<br>
"On Mathematicians"<br>
<br>
Paul Volcker stands up at six foot seven and grabs the box of Fruit Loops<br>
With his off hand puffs the cigar and thru front teeth smoke shoots<br>
He says Of course numbers are fictions<br>
He says The true religious zealots are mathematicians<br>
<br>
He says We can't say quick, we must say SOMETHING is quick<br>
He says We can't say six, we must say the amount of SOMETHING is six<br>
He says But what's the likelihood identical somethings exist?<br>
He says There must be ONE SOMETHING or ZERO SOMETHINGS<br>
any something more than one is ridiculoous<br>
<br>
<br>
"The Stochastic Nature of Dinner"<br>
<br>
Paul Volcker thinks an underrated cereal is Oreo-O's<br>
He thinks For better or worse all commitments have cons and pros<br>
He pours a cup of coffee, some delicious French espresso<br>
He says The stochastic is what you can't hold or let go<br>
<br>
Paul Volcker says Unions assist workers in achieving fair pay<br>
Paul Volcker says When financial institutions make mistakes they must be saved<br>
Paul Volcker looks at the box of Lucky Charms then he looks away<br>
Paul Volcker picks up a telephone and makes a reservation for 8<br>
