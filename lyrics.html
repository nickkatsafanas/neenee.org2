<b>Bananas are Yellow</b><br>
<br>
<u>"Blinders of Private Property"</u><br>
it's just the homeless <br>
who truly recognize the <br>
<br>
absurdity of <br>
recording events, i took <br>
a picture of a small pond <br>
<br>
<u>"Cuddly Beavers"</u><br>
sitting on a rock<br>
i took note of a cuddly<br>
<br>
beaver wiggling<br>
around my butt, right into<br>
a crevice, i was nervous<br>
<br>
<u>"This Dude Donnie"</u><br>
at 4 am a <br>
loud alarm was going off,<br>
<br>
this dude donnie said<br>
'i think the alarm's going<br>
off', and i knew he was right<br>
<br>
<u>"Composite Events"</u><br>
when it comes to the<br>
perception of objects we<br>
<br>
know there are different<br>
theories, let's leave composite<br>
events aside for right now<br>
<br>
<u>"Shopping at Lowe's"</u><br>
i couldn't truly<br>
say anything about the<br>
<br>
day was my first choice<br>
in life, i wasn't giddy<br>
as i bought the lowe's gift card<br>
<br>
<u>"I Don't Know"</u><br>
they said heroin<br>
addicts make great musicians<br>
<br>
and michael jackson<br>
didn't stick his penis up<br>
pre-teens' buttholes, i don't know<br>
