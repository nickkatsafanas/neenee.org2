<u>Press Release:</u>
<br>
Providence rock band Nee Nee makes its debut with this concise audio cassette EP <i>Bananas are Yellow</i>. Called both 'a communist book club' and 'a revolutionary ear drum testing bistro' by certain members of the press, the band combines vocalist Nick Peri's primitive drumming (done on Stagg childrens' snares and toms) with his unique take on the tanka poem, an ancient metrical form of Japanese literature. In place of rock's traditional electric guitar, the band uses an analog mixer modulated to produce distortion, feedback, and drones that are then improvised into solos. This debut EP contains 7 of their songs in a succinct 6 minute run-time.

01 it's just the homeless <br>
02 who truly recognize the <br>
<br>
03 absurdity of <br>
04 recording events, i took <br>
05 a picture of a small pond <br>
<br>
06 sitting on a rock <br>
07 i took note of a cuddly <br>
<br>
08 beaver wiggling <br>
09 around my butt, right into <br>
10 a crevice, i was nervous <br>
<br>
11 at 4 am a <br>
12 loud alarm was going off, <br>
<br>
13 this dude donnie said <br>
14 'i think the alarm's going <br>
15 off', and i knew he was right <br>
<br>
16 when it comes to the <br>
17 perception of objects we <br>
<br>
18 know there are different <br>
19 theories, let's leave composite <br>
20 events aside for right now <br>
<br>
21 i couldn't truly <br>
22 say anything about the <br>
<br>
23 day was my first choice <br>
24 in life, i wasn't giddy <br>
25 as i bought the lowe's gift card <br>
<br>
26 they said heroin <br>
27 addicts make great musicians <br>
<br>
28 and michael jackson <br>

30 pre-teens' buttholes, i don't know <br>
